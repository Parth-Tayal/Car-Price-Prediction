# Machine Learning Competition / Project

This project was created as part of my journey to practice and learn machine learning concepts. It focuses on applying different machine learning techniques and exploring their outcomes, making it a valuable resource for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be accessed via the following link:

https://github.com/rajtilakls2510/car_price_predictor/blob/master/quikr_car.csv

It provides a great opportunity to explore and understand the nuances of working with real-world data. Do experiment with it, apply your ideas, and draw your own conclusions.

## Note

To promote originality and genuine effort in learning, I have not included the final submission file in this repository. This decision ensures that others can build their understanding independently without simply copying a solution.

## Questions or Help

I am always happy to connect and assist fellow learners! If you:

* Are starting your journey in artificial intelligence and machine learning and need any help.

* Have any doubts or queries about this competition or the methodologies used in the project

Feel free to reach out. Collaboration and discussion help us all grow stronger in our learning paths.

Happy Learning! ðŸ˜Š
